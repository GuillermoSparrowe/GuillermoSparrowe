### About
I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and software development.  
I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects involving **machine learning with Python**, as well as **game development in Unity using C#**.  
My GitHub doesn’t yet reflect all my work — I’m currently organizing and uploading previous projects — but I enjoy experimenting, learning new tools, and improving my code through real-world practice.  

### Tech Stack
 `Python` · `PyTorch` · `Numpy` · `Java` · `SQL` · `MySQL` · `GitHub Actions` · `C#` · `C` · `Spiking Neural Networks` · `HTML`

### Featured Projects
- **Spiking Neural Network Research (Neuromorphic Systems Lab, OIT – Japan)**  
  Collaborative research project focused on **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** for visual pattern recognition.  
  The project was originally developed by other members of the neuromorphic systems laboratory, but I contributed with different improvements:  
  - Implemented a **Gabor-based preprocessing** pipeline to enhance spatial feature extraction from input images.  
  - Developed a **custom inhibitory learning rule** that dynamically adjusts synaptic weights, improving network stability and selectivity.
  
- Atom_Aumented_Reality: Educational AR application where the camera detects **periodic table elements** and overlays their **3D atomic structures** on top of each image.  
  When compatible atoms are brought together, they automatically combine into a **molecule**, allowing users to visualize bonding in real time.

- Climber!: Unity game made by myself that combines tetris and platforming at the same time. Not finished yet but I have plans for releasing it on the play store.
