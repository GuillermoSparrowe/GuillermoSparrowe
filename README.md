### About
I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and software development.  
I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects involving **machine learning with Python**, as well as **game development in Unity using C#**.  
My GitHub doesn’t yet reflect all my work — I’m currently organizing and uploading previous projects — but I enjoy experimenting, learning new tools, and improving my code through real-world practice.  

### Tech Stack
 `Python` · `PyTorch` · `Numpy` · `Java` · `SQL` · `MySQL` · `GitHub Actions` · `C#` · `C` · `Spiking Neural Networks` · `HTML`

<h1> Featured Projects</h1>

<h2> Spiking Network Contributions</h2>

<p>
  This repository showcases my <strong>personal contributions</strong> to a larger collaborative project on 
  <strong>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)</strong> developed within the 
  <strong>Neuromorphic Systems Laboratory at Osaka Institute of Technology (OIT)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The project focuses on a <strong>three-layer spiking neural network</strong> designed to 
  <strong>recognize handwritten digits</strong> from the <strong>MNIST dataset</strong>, providing a biologically inspired approach to image classification.
</p>

<p>
  My work focused on improving both the biological plausibility and performance of the network through the following contributions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of <strong>inhibitory plasticity (LTPi)</strong> to stabilize network activity and enhance learning robustness.</li>
  <li>Integration of <strong>Gabor-based visual preprocessing</strong> to extract orientation-selective features inspired by the human visual cortex.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These contributions led to a measurable improvement of <strong>+4.145%</strong> in classification accuracy compared to the original baseline implementation.
</p>

<p>
  Because the project was developed collaboratively, much of the core code is 
  <strong>intertwined with work from other researchers</strong>.  
  For this reason, I can only share <strong>selected modules and experiments</strong> that I developed myself, rather than the full implementation.

<h2> Atom_Augmented_Reality</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Atom_AR</strong> is an educational augmented reality application designed to make chemistry more interactive and intuitive.  
  Using the device camera, the app detects <strong>periodic table elements</strong> and overlays their corresponding <strong>3D atomic structures</strong> on top of each marker in real time.
</p>

<p>
  When two or more <strong>compatible atoms</strong> are brought close together, they automatically combine into a <strong>molecule</strong>, allowing users to visualize chemical bonding dynamically and explore molecular structures in an immersive way.
